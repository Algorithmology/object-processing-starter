"""Test suite for the process module."""

# TODO: Add all of the required test cases for the process module

# TODO: Note that some of the test cases in this test suite may require you to
# explore the use of mock objects or pytest test fixtures. After investigating
# these in greater detail and using generative AI techniques to help you to
# create a starting point for your tests, you can talk with the course
# instructor to learn more about how to add these components to your tests.
